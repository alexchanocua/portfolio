    stackExp: 'I built the project using React JS because of its performative, structured, and productive library. Leveraged Material UI responsive framework and the front end was deployed on GitHub Pages. ' +
        ' The backend was implemented using Node JS and Express for its quick set up and performance, PostgresSQL was used for the database, and both were deployed with Heroku.' +
